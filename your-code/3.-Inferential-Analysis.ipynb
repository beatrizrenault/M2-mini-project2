    "We're now going to look for answers to the ongoing basketball discussions between you and your family. The main ones we want to reasearch are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your grandmother says that your sister couldn't play in a professional basketball league (not only the WNBA, but ANY professional basketball league) because she's too skinny and lacks muscle.\n",
    "- Your sister says that most female professional players fail their free throws.\n",
    "- Your brother-in-law heard on the TV that the average assists among NBA (male) and WNBA (female) players is 52 for the 2016-2017 season. He is convinced this average would be higher if we only considered the players from the WNBA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's investigate these claims and see if we can find proof to refute or support them.\n",

    "The dataset we are working with contains personal data and game statistics for the 142 players of the WNBA. The data represents the performances of the players during all the games of the 2016/2017 season.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you that are less accustomed to basketball lingo here are some definitions:\n",
    "- **Field Goal**: any shot made from inside the 3-point line.\n",
    "- **Free Throws**: shots that are given to a player after they suffer a foul. The play stops and the player can freely shot from behind the free throw line.\n",
    "- **Rebound**: a recovered basketball after a failed shot. If the shot was made by a teammate it's an Offensive Rebound, if instead the shot was made by an opponent is a Defensive Rebound.\n",
    "- **Turnover**: losing a basketball before your team has had a chance of shooting the ball.\n",
    "- **Blocks**: blocking an opponent's shot.\n",
    "- **Double doubles**: a player is said to have performed a double-double when they accumulate at least a double digit number in two out of five of the main statistics: points, rebounds, blocks, steals and assists.\n",
    "- **Triple doubles**: same as double-double but with three out of five statistics.\n",
    "- **Positions**: here's the wikipedia page if you'd like to better understand the various positions in basketball: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions\n",
